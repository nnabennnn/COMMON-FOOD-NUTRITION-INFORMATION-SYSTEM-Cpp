COMMON FOOD NUTRITION INFORMATION SYSTEM

Despite global efforts, in 2022, an estimated 45 million children under the age of 5 suffered from waste, 148 million had stunted growth and 37 million were overweight. A fundamental shift in trajectory is needed to achieve the 2030 nutrition targets. Thus, the need for better nutrition was recognized in SDG 2, which aims to â€œend hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. A common food nutrition information system for Malaysians has been developed by the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Food Safety to achieve this goal. The aim of this system is to assist Malaysians in better comprehending their daily diet, which in turn aids in enhancing personal health. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security would like to hire your team to develop the system using C++ programming. The 'Nutrients_Info.csv' file provided in this assignment contains the food data set and must be considered as basic information for the system.
